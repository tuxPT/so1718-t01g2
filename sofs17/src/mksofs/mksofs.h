 * \brief Fill in the blocks of the free cluster table

 *      lower bytes to upper bytes, and from most significant bits (MSB) 
 *      to least significant bits (LSB).
 *      Thus, bit 0 corresponds to the most significant bit of the first byte of first block
 *      of the table.
 *      A bit at 1 means the corresponding cluster is free. Conversely, a bit at 0 means the
 *      corresponding cluster is in use.
 *      Bit 0, as the root occupies the first cluster, must be set in use.
 *      The number of bits in the table is, in general, greater than the number of clusters.
 *      The non used bits should be put as in use.
 * \param rmstart the number of the fisrt block used by the bit table
